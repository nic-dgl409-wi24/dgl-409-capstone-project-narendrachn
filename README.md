If you're looking to optimize your delivery routes, head to the "Route Optimization" feature. Enter multiple locations, and the system will calculate the most efficient route for you, taking into account factors like traffic conditions and distance.
(coming to Route optimization it is available in competitors app(Doordash and Skip the dishes) so i haven't done significant work on route optimization and taken class students reviews and suggestion to add this feature or not they suggested its not an important is something is available on other app how user navigate your site to exact same feature so I am partially not gonna add that feature now but i will think better way to present the issue i will add it in future.)

Spare parts locator  is a feature that can be used by car owners who need spare parts for their vehicles. The application will provide details about available spare parts based on their current city that they are travelling ( now i have based location to courtenay so it defaults it.)
